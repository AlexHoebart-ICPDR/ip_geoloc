Marker images for "IP Gelocation Views and maps" module
=======================================================

All you need to do to add a new marker image to your set of Google Map markers
is to drop a new .png image file in the /markers folder.

In order for the image to align exactly with its location beware of the
following:
o images size is expected to be approximately 21 pixels wide by 34 pixels heigh
o the anchor point of all marker images is expected to be at (10,34), i.e. at
  the bottom border of the image, in the middle.

Note: images in this folder are NOT used when you elect OpenLayers for your maps.
OpenLayers has its own set of markers, see the admin/structure/openlayers/maps
page and click edit or clone to open one of your maps. Then click the vertical
tab "Layers & Styles" to view available marker styles in the "Overlay layers"
section of the page.
